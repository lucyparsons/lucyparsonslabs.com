### Past Community Events

If you are looking for slides for previous trainings, they are all available [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/lpl-digital-security-and-foia-presentations-207834/).

In 2020, we hosted several digital security trainings at the Harold Washington Library- and then the COVID-19 pandemic began and we discontinued in person meetings. With restrictions lifting, we anticipate more FOIA workshops, digital security trainings, and Tacos & Tor events in the future. 

Lucy Parsons Labs held a public "Tacos and Tor" event where we discussed anonymous web browsing, the legacy of Tor, doing research and whistleblowing using the TAILS operating system, and more.

Lucy Parsons Labs along with Free Our Info hosted a free FOIA workshop where they covered how to craft a FOIA request for the first time, what to expect in response, and several tips and tricks on how to get the information quicker.

[Thotcon](https://www.thotcon.org/) hosted a [Cybersecurity Security Action Day](https://www.chipublib.org/blogs/post/guest-blog-cyber-security-take-action-saturday-october-13/), on October 13th, 2018 that mobilized volunteers over 150 locations in Chicago. Many Lucy Parsons Labs members volunteered at over four libraries on the day of action to assist librarians & the general public with their digital security concerns. 

[Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/) is Chicago’s weekly event to build, share, and learn about civic tech. In June of 2016, Jennifer Helsby and Freddy Martinez presented on the deployment of LPL’s [SecureDrop](/securedrop) system. ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKY_Sgv9ej8))

The [Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://www.eff.org/electronic-frontier-alliance) (EFA) hosted a workshop on surveillance self-defense in Chicago in March, 2016.
