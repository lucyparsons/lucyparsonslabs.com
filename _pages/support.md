Lucy Parsons Labs is entirely volunteer funded and directed. You can support Lucy Parsons Labs through DonorBox or Bitcoin or even a physical check. We are a registered IRS 501(c)3 not-for-profit so all donations are tax deductible. Our EIN is 81-3046769.

## One-time or Monthly Recurring Donations

The donor box button below allows you to donate one time or set up a monthly recurring donation. The best way to support our work is to setup a recurring donation, because this allows us to set a budget, manage long-term operating expenses as well as plan out future projects.
