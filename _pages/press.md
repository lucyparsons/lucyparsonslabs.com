## Collaborations

[FBI Provides Chicago Police With Fake Online Identities for “Social Media Exploitation” Team](https://theintercept.com/2022/05/20/chicago-police-fbi-social-media-surveillance-fake/) 
_The Intercept May 2022_
Lucy Parsons Labs took part in an interview about the Chicago Police Department's use of fake identities online, including using the accounts of informants. 

[ShotSpotter's deafening impact](https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/news/shotspotters-deafening-impact/)
_Chicago Reader, May 2022_
To build a map of ShotSpotter locations, the Reader and the independent research organization Lucy Parsons Labs compared work permits filed by Motorola Solutions—which installs surveillance devices for the city—and the Office of Emergency Management and Communications with data from the Department of Transportation. Our analysis located more than 750 apparent ShotSpotter devices spread throughout the city, including in districts the CPD has not publicly acknowledged as having them. 

[How Do I Prepare My Phone for a Protest](https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2022/05/10/how-do-i-prepare-my-phone-for-a-protest/)
_Amsterdam News, May 2022_
One thing demonstrators should be aware of before they head out is that their cellphones may subject them to surveillance tactics by law enforcement. If your cellphone is on and unsecured, not only can your location be tracked, but your messages and the content of your phone may also be retrieved by police either if they take custody of your phone or later by warrant or subpoena.

[Abolitionists Are Fighting Against the Surveillance State in Their Neighborhoods](https://truthout.org/audio/abolitionists-are-fighting-against-the-surveillance-state-in-their-neighborhoods/)
_Truthout, December 2021_
Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about things you should know if you want to change the world. I’m your host, writer and organizer, Kelly Hayes. We talk a lot on this show about building the relationships and analysis we need to create movements that can win. Today, we are talking about the surveillance state, and how a coalition of activists in Chicago is seeking to interrupt its work. The surveillance technology known as ShotSpotter sounds like something out of a modern dystopian novel: a sea of microphones, scattered across oppressed communities, supposedly to detect gunshots, for the purpose of community safety.

[Beneath the Surface is a project that investigates gender-based violence at the hands of the police](https://invisible.institute/beneath-the-surface)
_Invisible Institute, November 2021_
Beneath the Surface uses machine learning and narrative justice to better understand how marginalized communities experience police violence. The Invisible Institute has worked to make police complaint data public for years, but even when complaint data is public, significant information remains inaccessible. We hope this investigative journalism will strengthen the testimonies of, and advocacy efforts for, people most affected by advancing public conversation about policing, safety, and gender, while holding data science research accountable to lived experience and increasing the accessibility of public data. 

[Private Eyes: CPD pays for access to private security cameras](https://southsideweekly.com/private-eyes/)
_South Side Weekly, May 2021_
Those cameras are part of a network the City has quietly expanded since at least 2009 by subsidizing security cameras for renters, homeowners, and businesses who connect them to the department’s surveillance centers.  

[Op-Ed: End the City’s ShotSpotter Contract](https://southsideweekly.com/end-the-citys-shotspotter-contract/)
_South Side Weekly, April 2021_
ShotSpotter is only a single part of the surveillance network CPD and the City have built under the guise of public safety. The City similarly claims its automatic license plate readers deter carjackings (carjackings are up); says its gang database is effective (it’s woefully unreliable); promised its Summer Operations Center’s network of cameras and gunshot detectors would deter shootings (gun murders exploded, and the SOC surveilled a school during last year’s protests). 

[“That’s Bogus as Hell!”: Getting Under the Hood of Surveillance
Technologies in an Out of School STEM Learning Environment](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10207166)
_International Conferences of the Learning Sciences, June 2020_
This study investigates how opportunities to learn about the ethics of advanced
technologies emerged and were negotiated through interaction amongst students and instructors
in YPRPT, an out of school STEM learning environment. We present a microethnographic
analysis of a single pedagogical activity organized around GeoMedia, a tool we designed to
mimic authentic surveillance technologies currently used by numerous law enforcement
agencies. Our findings detail how the organization and unfolding of learning in the focal activity
created opportunities for students to explore “under the hood” of advanced technologies, and to
feel a sense of excitement and awe at the possibilities and perils of social media surveillance.
Additionally, our findings show how opportunities to learn were not solely constructed through
apriori pedagogical design, but also emerged through in-the-moment instructional decisions and
sequences of activity. This study has implications for participatory design possibilities grounded
in interdisciplinary collaboration between historically disparate disciplines like computer
science and civics. 

[YPRPT: Documentary Film Screenings](https://tree.northwestern.edu/news/2020-06-17-documentary-screenings)
_Block Museum Presents, June 2020_
In partnership with the TREE Lab in Northwestern’s School of Education and Social Policy, the Block Museum presented a special online screening, on June 17, 2020, of three documentaries produced by students of the Young People’s Race, Power, and Technology (YPRPT) project. YPRPT is an afterschool program, developed in partnership with community partners including Evanston Township High School, Family Matters, Endangered Peace, and the Lucy Parsons Labs, that brings together NU undergraduate students with youth and community members to jointly investigate the ethical and social dimensions of specific law enforcement technologies such as facial recognition and gang databases.

[The Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html)
_The New York Times, January 2020_
Photos “could be covertly taken with telephoto lens and input into the software, without ‘burning’ the surveillance operation,” the detective wrote in the email, provided to The Times by two researchers, Beryl Lipton of MuckRock and Freddy Martinez of Open the Government. They discovered Clearview late last year while looking into how local police departments are using facial recognition.

_OneZero, December 2019_
Hundreds of pages of internal documents obtained via FOIA requests by the ACLU of Illinois and the Lucy Parsons Labs, a Chicago-based police transparency and accountability nonprofit, reveals for the first time how the CPD surveils the social media accounts of victims of gun violence, as well as their friends and family members. Though the surveillance is conducted in an effort to gather further information about shootings, police officers also gather public social media content from individuals who apparently have little or nothing to do with the crime.

_Reason, July 2019_
Data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Lucy Parson Labs, a police accountability and transparency nonprofit in Chicago, shows that Chicago police executed  11,247 search warrants between 2012 and 2017, most of them heavily concentrated in the South and West Side of the city.

[This Predictive Policing Company Compares Its Software to ‘Broken Windows’ Policing](https://truthout.org/audio/abolitionists-are-fighting-against-the-surveillance-state-in-their-neighborhoods/)
_Vice, June 2018_
Police training documents from PredPol, a company that sells predictive policing software, shows that the company considers its software to be comparable to a “broken windows” policing strategy that has led to overpolicing of minority communities and is widely believed to be ineffective. The documents, obtained through a freedom of information request by digital rights group Lucy Parsons Labs from the Elgin, Illinois Police Department, include police training materials produced by PredPol and contracts between the city—a suburb of Chicago—and the company.

In collaboration with journalist [Joel Handley](https://twitter.com/joel_handley) and the *Chicago Reader*, Lucy Parsons Labs published an investigation into the use of civil asset forfeiture by Chicago Police. We show how Chicago Police seize millions from citizens and how they use this money to fund narcotics units and buy controversial surveillance equipment.

## In the News
[Youth as philosophers of technology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10749039.2022.2066134)
_Mind, Culture, and Activity, April 2022_
We explore the idea of youth as philosophers of technology within a university-community partnership in the Chicago area. Youth as philosophers of technology decenters computing practices such as design, making, coding, and tinkering to instead foreground learning how to decode and unmake tech’s relationship with power through artistic, moral and humanistic inquiry. Our analysis explores the ethical, relational sense-making of two high school students who created a film that examines how technology is used to surveil immigrants an to resist such surveillance. This study has implications for conceptualizing technology learning and ethical youth sensemaking.

_Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting, April 2022_
Now, the only reason that we know Clearview AI exists is because a couple of researchers, named Freddy Martinez and Beryl Lipton, filed public records requests around the country related to it. And Freddy Martinez, specifically, works for an organization called Open the Government, and he also is involved with a local organization called Lucy Parsons Labs in Chicago. And he had found out about Clearview and started filing tons of requests.

_Monterey County Weekly, March 2022_
Clearview’s existence was initially revealed via public records requests filed by Open the Government and MuckRock. In September 2021, as it faced still-ongoing litigation in Illinois, Clearview made an unusual and worrying move against transparency and journalism: it served subpoenas on Open the Government, its researcher Freddy Martinez, and Chicago-based Lucy Parsons Labs (none of whom are involved in the lawsuit).

[Push to Sue Gang Members Draws Criticism](https://chicagojustice.org/2022/02/15/push-to-sue-gang-members-draws-criticism/)
_Chicago Justice Project, February 2022_
A 2016 report by Lucy Parsons Labs and the Chicago Reader found that the Chicago Police Department was seizing millions of dollars in assets from city residents each year, with the funds forming an “off-the-books” revenue stream insulated from public scrutiny. The seizures, the report also found, disproportionately impacted poor and minority communities. In 2017, the Illinois legislature passed a law aimed at curtailing the practice of civil asset forfeiture through more robust protections for property owners and stiffer transparency requirements for law enforcement.

Nearly two months ago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot touted her plan to fight crime by suing gang leaders in civil court as a “critical piece of legislation” that would “restore safety and peace” to Chicago neighborhoods “under siege” from gang violence. ... 'Representatives of the ACLU of Illinois and Lucy Parsons Labs, which supports transparency and police reform efforts, said the matter had fallen off their radar — but they were tracking the issue, in case the mayor breathed new life into the proposal'

[Clearview AI drops subpoenas of its critics](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/27/clearview-facial-recognition-subpoenas-514338)
_Politico, September 2021_
Clearview AI drops subpoenas of its critics. The move comes after POLITICO reported Friday that Clearview had subpoenaed internal documents from watchdog group Open The Government, one of its top employees and the police accountability nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs.

['Chilling': Facial recognition firm Clearview AI hits watchdog groups with subpoenas](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/24/clearview-ai-subpoena-watchdog-groups-514273)

The firm served subpoenas in August to civil society coalition Open The Government, its policy analyst Freddy Martinez and the police accountability nonprofit that he’d previously founded, Lucy Parsons Labs — demanding any correspondence they’d had with journalists about Clearview and its leaders, as well as information they’d uncovered about the company and its founders in public records requests, over the last four years.


[In Chicago, Controversy Mounts Over the Use of Gunshot Detection Sensors](https://www.thetrace.org/2021/08/chicago-police-shotspotter-gunshot-detection-shooting-contract/)
_The Trace, August 2021_
In an internal performance overview obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the nonprofit transparency group Lucy Parsons Labs and shared exclusively with The Trace, ShotSpotter reported that during the first six months of 2021, its system successfully identified gunshots in Chicago more than 97 percent of the time. That rate was calculated based on details reported to ShotSpotter by the Chicago Police Department, but it included thousands of what the company called “probable” gunshots. There were no listed false positives — instances in which sounds identified as gunshots turned out to be something else.

_The Daily Mail UK, July 2021_
Freddy Martinez, director of the nonprofit the Lucy Parsons Lab, told WTTW, a PBS affiliate: 'ShotSpotter is not found in any majority-white neighborhoods, obviously we know that it's not the case that there's no gun violence in those neighborhoods. So what happens is that you have police officers thinking there's gunfire, racing to the scene where black and brown people are hanging out, and really just thinking that everyone is an armed suspect. It's quite dangerous and leads to very harmful interactions, which is one of the things we saw with the Adam Toledo case. If it wasn't for ShotSpotter, if it wasn't for the high-risk foot chase, then maybe that child would still be alive today.''

Established as counter-terrorism intelligence units after Sept. 11, 2001, to take in, analyze and share terrorist plots between federal, state and local police, dozens of fusion centers exist across the U.S. But far from an efficient network of intelligence sharing, they have become a sprawling national security apparatus dedicated to monitoring dissent far beyond their original statutory mission.

_The Verge, August 2020_
“A criminal hacker group Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDS) on 19 June 2020 conducted a hack-and-leak operation targeting federal, state, and local law enforcement databases, probably in support of or in response to nationwide protests stemming from the death of George Floyd,” the bulletin reads. “DDS leaked ten years of data from 200 police departments, fusion centers, and other law enforcement training and support resources around the globe, according to initial media and DHS reporting. DDS previously conducted hack-and-leak activity against the Russian Government.” The document was obtained by Lucy Parsons Lab researcher Brian Waters through an Illinois Freedom of Information Act request with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

_The Chicago Reporter June 2020_
New data released by the Chicago Police Department from the weekend following the death of George Floyd shows that just 20% of arrests during the first few days of unrest were for looting-related crimes, contradicting earlier claims by CPD that looting made up the majority of arrests that weekend. Most of the 1,052 arrests were actually for protest-related charges.

Even more troubling is the lack of public transparency in the Crime Lab’s collaboration with the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Groups like the Lucy Parsons Lab have claimed that as a recipient of government contracts, the Crime Lab (like the CPD) ought to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Regardless, police have declined to release data on how many people are involved in the Custom Notifications program. A Freedom of Information request from Freddy Martinez, a data activist who runs the nonprofit Lucy Parsons Labs, revealed that in 2016, 1,024 notifications were attempted, 558 were completed, and only 26 people attended a call-in, where police officers, social workers, and others offer support services. (Each of the notification attempts, says Mallette, could involve a visit to someone’s house. A completed notification, meanwhile, would include a face-to-face meeting.) The department makes it clear that for those who have interacted with the Custom Notifications program and are later charged with a crime, “the highest possible charges will be pursued.”
