Documents obtained exclusively by Lucy Parsons Labs reveal Chicago-area police
entered into a $50,000 dollar contract with a controversial facial recognition
company, Clearview AI, using counter-terrorism funds. Chicago Police obtained
the [funding](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400239-cpic_clearview_ai_refund_check_and_cancellation_memo) under the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) which the
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) funnels to local police in order to
“prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of
terrorism.” Clearview’s contract with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) was
[cancelled](https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/1/29/21080729/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-chicago-police-cpd) after public outcry over its [controversial data](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400239-cpic_clearview_ai_refund_check_and_cancellation_memo) collection in
violation of Illinois’ biometrics privacy law.

UASI funding to Clearview was approved by the First Deputy Superintendent of the
Chicago Police Department, Anthony Riccio, the second highest [ranking official](https://twitter.com/FOX2News/status/1323111377725198336)
within CPD. Riccio approved the funding for the software for use in the Crime
Prevention and Information Center (CPIC). CPIC is the Chicagoland-area “fusion
center" created after 9/11 to “improve the sharing of intelligence information
related to terrorism among federal, state and local authorities.” Over seventy
centers exist across the country and internationally. Fusion centers have long
been criticized for their documented history of [spying](https://theintercept.com/2020/08/17/blueleaks-california-ncric-black-lives-matter-protesters/) on First Amendment
activity and [fabricating](https://theintercept.com/2020/08/24/fbi-fusion-center-environmental-wind/) [threats](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/26/blueleaks-minneapolis-police-protest-fears/) against police and [corporations](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/16/wildfires-forest-jihad-blueleaks/).

Clearview AI is facing a number of [legal challenges](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/16/wildfires-forest-jihad-blueleaks/) after its indiscriminate
collection of [biometric data](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html) was revealed on the front page of the New York
Times. Among the legal arguments raised by Clearview is that the company is
not subject to the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act (BIPA) a law which requires
companies to obtain written permission from an individual before it can collect
biometric information such as facial geometry or fingerprints. However, the
Illinois Supreme Court has [rejected challenges](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/posts/BIPA-Victory/) to BIPA as urged by Lucy Parsons
Labs and other civil society groups.

Counter-terrorism funds flowing to Clearview are [part](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400239-cpic_clearview_ai_refund_check_and_cancellation_memo) of a [series](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400238-cpic_clearview_ai_privacy_accuracy_test_and_use_memoranda_cpic_report) of emails
filed as exhibits during ongoing litigation against the company. As part of its
legal defense, Clearview claims it is not soliciting business in Illinois in an
effort to dismiss the case against it. However, [documents](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400243-spingfield_emails) [obtained](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20400242-springfield_s19-92555-_redacted) by Lucy
Parsons Labs and filed in a sworn affidavit reveal this to be a lie.
